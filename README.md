# **MyWallet Application**

## **Description**

During last few years I've been tracking my income and expenses in notebook. After months and years amount of used paper became enormous and it's also easy to lose whole documentation.

That's the main reason why I started this project as a part of my Backend learning path. I wanted to keep whole informations close to me, dont waste paper and use whole process to become developer.

Application is not as easy as another ToDo List or simple Weather Application, but still not so complex to need help from few more developers.

## **Features:**

- Register/Login user
- CRUD methods for wallet (Budget) - for example you can split your wallet into few parts - Home Budget, Car budget, Savings - whatever you think is necessary for you.
- CRUD methods for transactions - each wallet has its own transactions and methods related to it
- Authorization and Authentication - your informations are only visible and changeable for you

## **To be implemented:**

- Refactor to other architecture
- Upgraded authentication
- Tests


## **Technologies used:**

- C#10 / .Net6
- Entity Framework 6.0.4

## **Feedback:**

Feel free to write to me about improving application, new ideas or talk with me how could I made it better and cleaner :)
